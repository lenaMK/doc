# […] and counting

Lena MK

Séminaire HAR7005, mai 2024



## Description

*[…] and couting* is an installation focusing on the history of public art made by womxn. Its central component is a map of the Tiohtià:ke · Montréal, cut out from an insulating panel made of extruded polystyrene. It is about 1.5 meters at its longest and half as wide, forming a crescent characteristic of the island’s topography. Its surface is covered in patches of white-beige hair, sourced from my dog’s shedding in the fall of 2023. The patches fill the gaps between the pattern formed by the urban cycling paths, hand drawn with a light orange felt pen. Sticking out from the patches are acupuncture needles indicating the location of the first – 18 at the instantiation of the project – public artworks made by womxn.

For its participatory activation, the map rests flat, propped up to a table’s height. it is accompanied by a set up of a computer and a second screen, displaying source code and a digital version of the map. Run on a localhost, modifying the source code updates the map to reflect the addition of a further public artwork by a womxn. Participants are invited to 

- add « to the count » in the code,
- search for the new artwork on the digital map, using the browser console to access the metadata of the artwork,
- and place a new needle on the equivalent location of the physical map. 

To find the location, they can use the other needles/artworks as references while also following the both tactile and visual topographical references of the cycling paths and the fur patches. The title updates the count as each participatory action enriches the map, progressively activating a new narrative on public art and its history.

## Contexte de recherche-création

### Théorie et pratiques de la cartographie

indigenous geographies representations challenge dominant cartographic imaginations and methods that exclude all non-European modes of knowledge and representation. By reflecting dominant notions of territoriality and shedding light on different human-space interactions, indigenous cartography serves as inspiration for non-hegemonic and emancipatory practices (Halder and Michel 2018: 16)

calls for the production of new radical imageries and *elaboration of conceptual and analytical tools that enable the visualization of the ever more sophisticated structures* of capitalism which provoke new situations of opposition and political engagement (Mesquita 2018: 26)
