> I choose to work with forms and objects that, like beadwork, have an  overt—if often overlooked—relationship to gratitude, exchange and  commerce, land, and the shaping, and morphing ability of language.  Sculptural geometries are a meeting point for technologies, stories, and lineages of knowledge. Translating everyday, accessible objects into  beadwork re-presents regular things from our daily lives to reattune us  to their attraction and code-switching, overlapping, shifting resonances across cultural contexts and modes of identity. This deep layering of  held meaning about the connectivity of the past and present,  cross-cultural interweaving, and both the harshness and beauty of our  current reality shapes and motivates my practice.

> ***Soft Computing\*** is a series of plush dolls that depict technologies. It reconfigures our physical relationship to devices such as desktop computers, keyboard, mice, cell phones, and ethernet cables. As technologies get closer and closer to the body in our back pockets, our laps, and in our beds they still remain obstinately hard. Plushies, on the other hand, are huggable media: soft to the touch and very willing to accept our embrace. (Artist statement)

> The digital medium exhibits distinguishing characteristics, which are often used in varying combinations. 
>
> - It is **interactive**, allowing forms of navigating, assembling, or contributing to artwork to go beyond the mental event of experiencing it. 
> - It often is **dynamic**, responding to a changing data flow and real-time data transmission. 
> - The art is not always collaborative in the original sense of the word, but **often participatory**, relying on multiuser input. 
> - Another distinguishing feature of the digital medium is that it can be **customizable and adaptable** to a single user’s needs or intervention. 
> - While some of these concepts have been explored in performance art, happenings, and video art, the **possibilities of remote and immediate intervention** are unique to the networked digital medium. 
> - The interactive, digital medium has **challenged traditional notions of the artwork, audience, and artist**. 
> - Developments in this object suggest a **paradigm shift for art practice from the art object to the postobject conditions of possibility and a fluid interaction between different manifestations of information**.
