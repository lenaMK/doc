> I choose to work with forms and objects that, like beadwork, have an  overt—if often overlooked—relationship to gratitude, exchange and  commerce, land, and the shaping, and morphing ability of language.  Sculptural geometries are a meeting point for technologies, stories, and lineages of knowledge. 
>
> Translating everyday, accessible objects into  beadwork re-presents regular things from our daily lives to reattune us  to their attraction and code-switching, overlapping, shifting resonances across cultural contexts and modes of identity. <!--objets qui sont des lieux communs-->
>
> This deep layering of  held meaning about the connectivity of the past and present,  cross-cultural interweaving, and both the harshness and beauty of our  current reality shapes and motivates my practice.

> ***Soft Computing\*** is a series of plush dolls that depict technologies. It reconfigures our physical relationship to devices such as desktop computers, keyboard, mice, cell phones, and ethernet cables. As technologies get closer and closer to the body in our back pockets, our laps, and in our beds they still remain obstinately hard. Plushies, on the other hand, are huggable media: soft to the touch and very willing to accept our embrace. (Artist statement)

> The digital medium exhibits distinguishing characteristics, which are often used in varying combinations. 
>
> - It is **interactive**, allowing forms of navigating, assembling, or contributing to artwork to go beyond the mental event of experiencing it. 
> - It often is **dynamic**, responding to a changing data flow and real-time data transmission. 
> - The art is not always collaborative in the original sense of the word, but **often participatory**, relying on multiuser input. 
> - Another distinguishing feature of the digital medium is that it can be **customizable and adaptable** to a single user’s needs or intervention. 
> - While some of these concepts have been explored in performance art, happenings, and video art, the **possibilities of remote and immediate intervention** are unique to the networked digital medium. 
> - The interactive, digital medium has **challenged traditional notions of the artwork, audience, and artist**. 
> - Developments in this object suggest a **paradigm shift for art practice from the art object to the postobject conditions of possibility and a fluid interaction between different manifestations of information**.

### *The Computer as a Dynamic Medium*

Le milieu de l’art algorithmique (ou art génératif) [^4] apporte une toute autre réflexion sur l’ordinateur et la notion de medium. En effet, dans ce domaine également appelé « *computer art* » en anglais, se pose rapidement la question: l’ordinateur est-il un medium artistique?

[Nick Lambert](https://nicklambert4.wixsite.com/nickresearch/about), chercheur reconnu dans le milieu de l’art algorithmique et auteur de la thèse « A critical examination of ‘computer art’ » (2003), a publié sa conférence donnée à la Computer Art and Technocultures (CAT) 2010 London Conference intitulée « The Computer as a Dynamic Medium ». Il effectue un tour d’horizon de diverses postures, de théoriciens ainsi que d’artistes en art algorithmique, questionnant le potentiel de l’ordinateur comme medium artistique. 

> The computer is simultaneously tool, interface, surface and material; in this it is quite unlike any previous art medium” (Lambert 2010:  87)
>
> [In] Computer Art the real medium is software art, the computer is only a mere thing.” (Lambert 2010: 88)
>
> the computer in art could be what Alan Kay (quoted by Larry Cuba) considers to be a meta-medium because of its power to simulate other media” (Lambert, 2010, p. 89(
>
> the fact that multiple environments and expectations can exist simultaneously on one machine demonstrates its status as a **meta-medium** (Lambert, 2010, p. 89)
>
> When computer images are created and displayed, the computer also functions as an intermediary for the artist and viewer to see its visual content . 
> The artist can only interact with computational processes by treating them as program elements – directing their operation and outcomes – or by using physical devices to move proxies around the screen. The artist cannot enter the **digital environment** itself, but they can influence it from the outside.
> The viewer, meanwhile, can only see these results displayed on the screen, unless they are printed or recorded on film. In this sense, the computer becomes an “**intermedium**” – a quasi-physical digital substrate which enables interaction or viewing. (Lambert, 2010, p. 89)

- “Stephen R. Ellis considers an **environment** to be “the theater of human activity” which consists of a content, a geometry and dynamics” (Lambert, 2010, p. 90) <!-- l’espace numérique comme environnement de travail de certains artistes-->
  - “The content consists of both the actors and the objects with which they interact. The geometry is a description of the properties of the stage of action. The dynamics describes the rules of interaction between the actors and the objects. [...] [10]” (Lambert, 2010, p. 90)
  - “content is provided by the artist and their interaction with the computer, including the alterations and developments its usage engenders” (Lambert, 2010, p. 90)
  - “geometry comes from the structure of the interface, the type of software, the artist’s knowledge and their comprehension of the computer as **instrument**” (Lambert, 2010, p. 90) <!--utilisation différentiée selon les connaissances de l’instrument-->
  - “dynamics stems from the properties of the software or programming skills they are using: it provides the parameters within which they work” (Lambert, 2010, p. 90)
  - “Describing the computer as an environment, including its physical devices (keyboard, mouse etc.) and its dynamic non-physical aspects, is closer to its role in art than calling it a “medium”.” (Lambert, 2010, p. 90)
  - “this situation goes beyond an artist standing in relation to his tools; rather, it is the relation of the mind’s conceptions to the opportunities and constraints presented by the environment.[11]” (Lambert, 2010, p. 90)
  - “In the computational environment, the image and its associated tools exist at a higher level than the data: they are the form but not the matter” (Lambert, 2010, p. 90)
- “The matter – instructions in code – is fundamentally linked to the form and provides its substructure, but it has no direct visual correlation. In this sense, it exists in a different space from the artist and for this reason can be wholly manipulated and altered in a way impossible for physical materials which share the artist’s space” (Lambert, 2010, p. 90)
- “Do all computers running the same program and using the same data set partake of the same image space? Or is it only re-created every time it is displayed?” (Lambert, 2010, p. 91)
  - “Is the image seen at every workstation the same image, or simply the same environment displayed in slightly different ways?” (Lambert, 2010, p. 91) 
  - “The question does not arise for TV or video footage because it is recorded as an image and thus every iteration is a duplicate” (Lambert, 2010, p. 91) 
  - “By contrast, the computer re-creates the image every time the code is processed.” (Lambert, 2010, p. 91) 
- “Binkley argues that the computer, functioning simultaneously as the image space, the tools for executing the design and the display medium, contributes to the conceptual creation of the artwork rather than simply providing the means for its reification” (Lambert, 2010, p. 92) 
- “computer graphics “effectively interfaces with man via light. The images have no mass, no physical substance in a sense, but they are perceivable and meaningful to the viewer.”[17]” (Lambert, 2010, p. 93) 
- “An artist using the computer can see into another medium, and by using interfaces they can operate and affect this medium, even to the extent of being able to feel sensations that correspond to the surfaces and masses of objects therein. But they can never enter this medium, there can never be direct physical contact or immersion in this space, because the medium they inhabit is wholly different” (Lambert, 2010, p. 93) 

  - “they cannot enter his except through visual displays or being physically rendered into inert objects, at which point they lose their digital basis and are transmuted into chunks of solid matter” (Lambert, 2010, p. 93)
