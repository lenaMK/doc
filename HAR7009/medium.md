> I choose to work with forms and objects that, like beadwork, have an  overt—if often overlooked—relationship to gratitude, exchange and  commerce, land, and the shaping, and morphing ability of language.  Sculptural geometries are a meeting point for technologies, stories, and lineages of knowledge. Translating everyday, accessible objects into  beadwork re-presents regular things from our daily lives to reattune us  to their attraction and code-switching, overlapping, shifting resonances across cultural contexts and modes of identity. This deep layering of  held meaning about the connectivity of the past and present,  cross-cultural interweaving, and both the harshness and beauty of our  current reality shapes and motivates my practice.
