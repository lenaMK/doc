# Imagining public art : feminist and algorithmic cartographies

XXIInd Spring School of Art History, « Social imagining and the role of images, artworks and buildings », Weimar, Germany, 17-21 June 2024

## Abstract

In my doctoral research, I experiment with visual and algorithmic creations to give a new form of
access to cultural data. GLAM (galleries, librairies, archives and museums) institutions are currently
creating data about their collections and my research aims to exemplify the use of counter-curation
and of interactive data visualisation as æsthetic, sensitive and non-hierarchical ways to access cultural
contents. The production of charts or of new visual forms not only creates representations of these
collections, but in the case of interactive visualisations, they also enable the discovery of their
contents. In a complementary way to cultural mediation and to curation, it becomes possible to give
access to art through serendipity and sensibility.
During the Spring School, I would like to present a case study on public art in Montreal (Qc, Canada).
Public art is an art form that is particularly subject to over-representation of normativity: men artists of
European or colonial origins, colonial topics favoured by institutional powers, capitalistic vision of
society, and thinking about land through extractivism. These narratives form the current imaginary on
art in public space and marginalise a diversity of contributions by women and BIPOC artists for
example.
My research aims to renew this imaginary of public art by thwarting these norms of visibility. I use
data on public art[^1] to suggest counter-narratives, focused on the entry of women·x artists in public
space. I will illustrate this practice with three examples from my algorithmic counter-curation
experiments: an interactive map accessible on the web, an algorithmic artwork, and a physical map
[^2] .

[^1]: This research is part of « Towards a digital common of public art » research project by Maison MONA and funded by the Canadian Arts Council), lead by Julie Graff, Camille Delattre, Alexia Pinto Ferretti, Simon Janssen, David Valentine and myself. In this large undertaking on public art and its visibility in the digital realm, we have collected data identifying and referencing public art artists active in Quebec and who have at least one artwork in the MONA database. This database was initially created as a data source for the MONA mobile app. It brings together public art collections in Quebec to facilitate their in situ cultural mediation with a mobile app.

## Presentation

- PhD at UdeM, research-creation (practice-based research) project in art history, and more specifically in data visualisation

### Social imaginings of public art

<!--memes as great examples of images that build on, and are built on, a social imaginary?-->

#### image atlas « public art »





### algorithmic imaginary - algorithmic imagination?

#### algorithmic imaginary

- Bucher 2018: imaginaire des utilisateurs de ce qu’est / doit faire / .. un algorithme
- Schulz 2023: inclure les processus inter-instititutionnels par l’épaisseur/étagement des imaginaires selon Castoriadis, de l’imaginaire radical à l’imaginaire social (institué), en passant par l’imaginaire périphérique et l’imaginaire central

<!--admit to misunderstanding the word on first reading-->

#### Algorithmic practices

- code, scripts, algorithms: the daily bread of a developer (to distinguish with data)
- algorithmic art: 
  - part of software engineering, part of digital art world
  - using algorithms to make art, early examples Vera Molnar 1960s

#### counter-curation & mapping

- Kreps: curatorship as a social practice
- Kathke, Tomann and Uhlig 2022	
- Orangotango+: counter-mapping

data curation → counter-curation of GLAM+ data



### Experiments in feminist and algorithmic cartographies

Contexte: 

- experiments in data visualisations <!--or digital witchcraft-->
- Maison MONA: Towards a digital commons of public art
- data: identification de l’identité de genre de ~700 artistes pour un total de ~1500 œuvres d’art public à Montréal et au Québec

#### Interactive map - web interface

interactive data visualisation notebook(s)?



#### Figures historiques

- algorithmic art course (Benoit Baudry, IFT6251, 2024)
- data art → first experiment with the MONA data 
- from the titles to a visual expression
- very abstract, far from classical data visualisation 

#### […] and counting



#### Brodin
